## Example

```snbt
{
  Inventory: {
    can_be_siphoned_from: false,
    inventory_name: "{\"text\":\"Custom Inventory Name\"}",
    inventory_type: "chest",
    display_block: {
      Name: "minecraft:barrel",
      BlockStates: {
        facing: "top"
      }
    },
    auto_save: {
      storage: "item"
    }
  }
}
```

## Storage Types

- `item` Will save the container's items onto the selected item. `/data get entity @s SelectedItem.tag.items[]`
- `enderChest` will save your items to your ender chest, There is an issue where if you have your item ender chest open and you add items to your block ender chest it will remove the item. (not multiplayer tested) `/data get entity @s EnderItems[]`
- `cloud` will save your items to the world, works similar to ender chest but only works with the custom item, Like a global `enderchest`. `data get storage morenbt:cloud Items[]`
