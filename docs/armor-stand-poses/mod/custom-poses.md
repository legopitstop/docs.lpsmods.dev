# Custom Poses

Armor Stand Poses supports custom poses letting you create your own!

1. Create a folder in the `/data/<namespace>` path of your datapack called `pose`.
1. Create a JSON file in the created folder. This can be called anything as long as it ends with ".json"
1. Using the [Pose Format](./pose-format) page, create your own pose.
1. Now to run `/reload` in-game for the changes to apply. Then keep right-clicking on an armor stand until it stops on your pose.
