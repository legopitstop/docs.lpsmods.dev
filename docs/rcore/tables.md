# Tables

Create your own crafting table using LPS Rcore API.

Tables are stored in `rcore:register tables`.

## Create Table

1. Create a MCFUNCTION file in your datapack called tables.mcfunction. This file can be located anywhere in your datapack.
1. Now using the [NBT Schema](#table-schema) and [examples](./example-tables.md) from below you can add all your tables to the created tables.mcfunction.
1. You now need to create a function tag located `data/rcore/tags/functions/register_tables.json` and enter the path to your tables function.
1. Now in-game run `/reload` to reload your datapack. Then run `/function rcore:reload` to reload all tables.

## Obtaining

To obtain your table using commands use the following commands in a MCFUNCTION file. Make sure to replace "example:my_table" with the ID of your table.

```mcfunction
data modify storage rcore:api find set value "example:my_table"
function rcore:crafting_table/drop
```
