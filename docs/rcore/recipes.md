# Recipes

Create your own NBT recipes using LPS Rcore API.

Recipes are stored in `rcore:register recipes`.

## Create Recipe

1. Create a MCFUNCTION file in your datapack called `recipes.mcfunction`. This file can be located anywhere in your datapack.
1. Now using the [NBT Schema](#recipe-schema) and [examples](./example-recipes.md) from below you can add all your recipes to the created recipes.mcfunction.
1. You now need to create a function tag located `data/rcore/tags/functions/register_recipes.json` and enter the path to your recipes function.
1. Now in-game run `/reload` to reload your datapack. Then run `/function rcore:reload` to reload all recipes

## Minecraft Recipes

To register a Minecraft recipe (Recipe hidden behind a settings toggle.) follow all the steps above but instead of adding the recipes function in `register_recipes.json` you add it to `register_minecraft_recipes.json` in the same folder.
